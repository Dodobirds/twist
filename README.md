## Text with a Twist
##### Steven Chen

@AndyNinjaNovoProf b339c5df4b4021e950e834c358d5299edeb696f0 is the commit as I write this readme

A **very** simple clone of text-twist, where you make as many words as possible out of 6 letters

Built on the LAMP stack subbing MySQL for SQLite

Test by running on a local server using a command such as:
```
php -S localhost:port
```
### Instructions
No start screen, just press 'Next Round' to grab a new rack. Type with the keyboard and check with 'Submit' or `Enter`. If you get a word, then the numbers to the left with decrement.


### TODO
##### If I get inspired enough to work on this latter
1. Properly implement timer and score
2. php is hacked together because I realized my mistake very late in
3. Fix the ajax calls in the javascript to match the rest of the file
4. I might be weak to sqlinjects, not sure
5. Properly learn http
6. center the css better
7. document and comment
8. Implement a start/end screen
